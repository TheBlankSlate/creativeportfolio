            I started coding in 6th grade but it wasn't anything advanced back then. The only languages we learned were HTML/CSS and Blockly. It wasn't until 10th grade where I learned my first "advanced" coding language, C#. I also started to dabble with other languages such as Python. Come 11th grade, I learned even more languages like Kotlin, Java, Node JS JavaScript, a little bit of C++, and others. I'm  currently still learning C++ in my school. Using these languages I am able to make various programs like video game plugins/mods, Discord "Bots" (they are plugins), music plugins and even a full blown operating system.
