            I started making videos back when I was 10 years old. I was inspired by a YouTuber named Stampylongnose. Because he made Minecraft game-play videos I wanted to do the same. after years of cringe videos off all types, such as other games, vlogging, and even reacting to my own videos videos, I am very proud of the progress that I am making.  Other videos that I have made include: 3d animations, Lyric Videos, Music Visualizers, Minecraft tutorials, Music Videos, Gear Reviews/Unboxing Videos, Satirical PSAs, Short Films, and also Game Reviews and slow motion fire videos. I took a film scoring class in 2019 and with that knowledge I score the videos from my school's film club.
