            I grew up listening to Christian Contemporary/Worship music, Jazz, and Classical music. CCM/Worship music is a huge part of my life because that's what my parents play on the radio every time I'm in the car. I started listing to jazz music when my older brother joined the jazz band at the middle school. I too joined the jazz band when I entered 6th grade and have played drums since. I don't listen to jazz all that much anymore as my older siblings are now in college and I don't play in the jazz band because I don't go to the public high school. I have some experience playing classical music, as a percussionist, because I played in the school band when I was in 4th grade and continued with it until 8th grade.  <br /><br/>
            In 2014, everything changed  when I began playing Minecraft, which introduced me to Electronic music.  I was fascinated by the sounds that were used in the songs and how catchy they were. I was inspired learn how to make my own electronic music. my first experience making it was with a online program called Buttonbass. My first interaction with a DAW was using a online program called Soundation. <br /><br/>
            After some experimenting with Soundation, I switched to a new DAW, this time downloaded, called LMMS. LMMS is a very powerful DAW housing some features that can easily rival other DAWs like Ableton Live or FL Studio. After that, I got my first midi controller, an Akai MPK Mini Mk II. That came with a DAW called Reason, specifically Reason 10 Lite. I loved Reason so much that when Reason 11 came out, I upgraded from Reason 10 Lite to Reason 11 [standard].  In fact, pretty much all of the songs I've made and posted on my YouTube channel where made using Reason. There are a few exceptions however, such as my song, Universe, being made with Pro Tools or my remix of Sarah Lynch's song called Alone, using Ableton Live 10 [Suite]. <br /><br/>
            Throughout the years of making music, I have acquired many skills. Studying music theory has helped me write better, catchier melodies. I also now have an understanding of the relationships among scales, chords, and harmonies.  Additionally. I have a better grasp on how music ties to different emotions. Along with music theory, I've also practiced the art of Mixing, using tools like gain, compression, EQ, and panning to make my music sound better. I've also dabbled in mastering and how that leads to finalizing a song and adding the finishing touches. Through arrangement, I am able to make full songs that includes an Intro, a verse, a build up, and drop, a chorus, another verse, and so on. <br /><br/>
            I have learned about sound design and how to use subtractive and wavetable synths. I am able to modulate the sound through my knowledge of arpeggios, being used with MIDI as well as effect plugins, automation, and AI components to effect MIDI data. Through these methods, I'm able to make any sound I can think of.<br /><br/>
            Some short term goals  that I have are to be able to rely less on presets and more on sound design, and also incorporate my acoustic drums more into the songs that I make. Some long term goals that I have are to be able to perform a song live, get signed by Monstercat/No Copyright Sounds (NCS), make music for films/videogames, and build a giant modular synth.
